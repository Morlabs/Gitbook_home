# Remuneration

### Overview

Trinity DAO adopts a transparent and equitable compensation model for its council members and contributors, utilizing Trinity DAO tokens as the primary means of remuneration. This document details the compensation structure and guiding principles.

### Compensation Methodology

* **Form of Compensation:** Compensation is provided exclusively in Trinity DAO tokens, aligning recipients with the DAO's success and governance.
* **Payment Mechanism:** Compensation is delivered through Superfluid streams, facilitating continuous and real-time token flows. This method ensures an efficient and flexible compensation process.

### Allocation and Distribution of Tokens

* **DAO-Wide Allocation:** Trinity DAO determines the total token allocation for each Sub-DAO, based on strategic significance, operational requirements, and performance.
* **Council Member Compensation:** Council members are compensated with a fixed token amount set by Trinity DAO. This amount reflects the governance, oversight, and responsibilities shouldered by council members.
* **Sub-DAO Contributor Compensation:** The council of each Sub-DAO decides the compensation for its contributors. This approach allows for compensation to be tailored to the roles, performance, and contributions of individual members.
* **Stream Setup and Start:** Each Sub-DAO council is tasked with setting up their own Superfluid streams for distributing tokens to contributors. There is no cliff period, and the streams start as soon as appointments or contributions begin, ensuring immediate and continuous compensation.

### Principles of Compensation

* **Equity and Fairness:** Compensation aims to be equitable and fair, acknowledging the contributions of all members across the organization.
* **Transparency:** The determination and distribution of compensation are transparent processes. Decisions regarding token amounts are openly communicated within the DAO.
* **Alignment with DAO Goals:** By compensating in Trinity DAO tokens, the interests of council members and contributors are aligned with the DAO's long-term objectives, promoting decisions and contributions that benefit the DAO and its community.

### Implementation

Trinity DAO and the councils of each Sub-DAO oversee the implementation of this compensation model. Regular evaluations ensure the model remains competitive, equitable, and in tune with Trinity DAO's evolving goals.

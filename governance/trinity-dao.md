# Trinity DAO

**Governance Structure of MOR Labs and Trinity DAO**

MOR Labs operates through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure known as Trinity DAO, which is further segmented into a sub-DAO framework. This structure ensures that each sub-DAO has clearly defined roles and responsibilities, enabling efficient operation and task execution.

**Central Governance and Oversight**

Trinity DAO is governed by its token holders and a Network Council that sits atop all of the Sub-DAOs. This Network Council:

* Reviews and ratifies improvement proposals that have been submitted for community voting, playing a pivotal role in the DAO's evolution and growth.
* Functions as the Arbitration Council Sub-DAO, offering a structured approach to mediate and resolve conflicts that arise within or between sub-DAOs, upholding the unity and coherence of the Trinity DAO community.
* Acts as the guardian of the community's multisig, enabling decisive action during critical situations to maintain the DAO's integrity and ensure its smooth operation across all activities

Council members are appointed by token holders following the inaugural term, ensuring democratic governance and alignment with the community's interests. All Council members have transparent contracts with their duties and tenure detailed on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).

The organisational structure of Trinity DAO can be shown below.

**Sub-DAO Councils**

Each sub-DAO operates under the guidance of its own council, which is responsible for overseeing contributors and managing the sub-DAOâ€™s specific infrastructure. Council members are elected by Trinity DAO, with their duties and tenure detailed in contracts stored on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).

The Product Sub-DAOs within Trinity DAO operate under a model similar to the "pizza team" concept, emphasizing the importance of small, agile teams. This approach is based on the idea that a team should be small enough that it could be fed with just two pizzas. The philosophy behind this is to keep teams lean and agile, fostering enhanced communication, collaboration, and efficiency.

In these Product Sub-DAOs, teams are comprised of cross-domain experts who bring together diverse skills and perspectives needed to develop, manage, and optimize the DAO's digital products. This setup ensures that each team member plays a crucial role, contributing their unique expertise while working closely with others to achieve common goals.

Such a configuration allows for:

* **Rapid Decision-Making:** Smaller teams can make decisions more quickly without the need for extensive meetings or layers of approval.
* **Increased Accountability:** With fewer members, each individual's contributions are more visible, increasing ownership and accountability for the project's success.
* **Better Communication:** A tighter-knit group facilitates easier and more effective communication, reducing the chances of misunderstandings and ensuring everyone is on the same page.
* **Flexibility and Adaptability:** Small teams can adapt more quickly to changes or pivot their strategy based on feedback and market dynamics.
* **Enhanced Collaboration:** Cross-domain experts can more easily share knowledge and collaborate on solutions, leading to innovative approaches and problem-solving.

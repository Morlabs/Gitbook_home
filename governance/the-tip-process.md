# The TIP Process

Trinity Improvement Proposals (TIPs) are design documents used to propose changes to the Trinity ecosystem. TIPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for proposing new features, collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into the Trinity protocol.

TIPs are a convenient way to track the progress of an implementation. TIPs are presented to Trinity tokenholders for voting through the voting dapp to determine whether they will be accepted or rejected.

TIPs need to provide a concise technical specification of the request. [View existing MIPs](https://github.com/Morlabs/MIPS) here. \
\
To create one yourself,  first review TIP-1.[^1] Then, [clone the repository](https://github.com/Morlabs/MIPS?tab=readme-ov-file) and add your TIP to it following [the template TIP](https://github.com/Morlabs/MIPS/blob/main/MIP\_template.md) and submitting a Pull Request to MIPs repository.\

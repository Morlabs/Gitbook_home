# Contribution Guidelines

#### Introduction

By leveraging your unique skills and interests, you can significantly impact our progress and innovation in the DeAI revolution. Here, you'll find everything you need to identify opportunities, submit contributions, and understand the rewards process.

#### How to Contribute

Trinity DAO accepts contributors of many types, including both **part-time contributors** as well as **full-time contributors**. In both cases, the starting point is to determine where in the organisation you would most like to contribute to.&#x20;

A good starting point is to look at the list of [Approved Projects](https://github.com/README.md). This should give you an indication of where the DAO is currently prioritising resource allocation. \
\
**Joining as a Council Member**

If you have previous experience in a leadership position, you may be interested in joining one of the Sub-DAOs as council member. Council members in Trinity DAO oversee operations, manage contributor compensation, resolve conflicts within their Sub-DAO, and ensure their actions align with the DAO's overarching goals and community interests.\
\
Review the list of Sub-DAOs together with the Council application requirements. \
\
**Joining as a Contributor**\
\
Contributors in Trinity DAO undertake tasks and projects aligned with their Sub-DAO's goals, engage in governance, uphold DAO principles, and work under the direction of the relevant Council to advance the DAO's mission.\
\
As a guideline, Council members typically require Contributors to complete at least 3 paid bounties for the Sub-DAO before they would consider a more permanent engagement. \
\
You can view a list of the [Open Positions](https://github.com/Morlabs/Contributions/tree/main/Recurring\_tasks/Open\_positions). If you see something you like, follow the application process listed on the relevant position.&#x20;

**New ideas**\
\
If you would like to work on something new, not already included within the [Approved Projects](https://github.com/README.md), you should [create a TIP](../governance/the-tip-process.md). Should it receive positive community feedback, the TIP can then put be to a DAO vote. \
\
**Not sure where to start?**&#x20;

If you're unsure how you can best contribute to the organisation or have additional questions, we recommend speaking with the relevant Sub-DAO Council that best suits your skill sets and interests. You can find their contact details here. \

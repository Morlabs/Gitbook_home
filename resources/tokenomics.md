# Tokenomics

#### Enhanced Network Security through Staked Guarantees

Owners of NFAs are required to stake MOR tokens as a form of security deposit, ensuring their agents operate within the ecosystem's guidelines and standards. This mechanism serves as a powerful deterrent against malicious or inefficient agents by imposing a financial stake in the performance and behavior of NFAs. The need to acquire MOR for these security guarantees directly drives demand for the token, as more developers and users engage with the ecosystem.

#### Incentivizing Responsible Agent Deployment

By tying the deployment and operation of NFAs to staked MOR tokens, the ecosystem incentivizes responsible development and management of agents. Developers and users must carefully consider the design and function of their NFAs, knowing that their staked MOR is at risk should their agent act maliciously or disruptively. This careful consideration fosters a more secure, efficient, and reliable ecosystem, indirectly bolstering the value and demand for MOR.

#### Governance Participation and Ecosystem Investment

Staking MOR tokens for NFA security guarantees integrates seamlessly with governance participation. MOR holders, particularly those invested in the development and deployment of NFAs, are likely to be more engaged with ecosystem governance, voting on proposals that directly affect the operational framework of NFAs. This active participation ensures a vested interest in the ecosystem's health and governance, further driving MOR demand.

#### Reward Mechanisms and Ecosystem Growth

The MOR staking mechanism extends beyond security guarantees, offering potential rewards for NFA performance and contributions to the ecosystem. High-performing or valuable NFAs can generate returns for their owners, creating a compelling incentive for developers and users to acquire and stake MOR. As the ecosystem grows and the utility of NFAs expands, the demand for MOR is expected to increase correspondingly.
